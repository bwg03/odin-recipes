    <h1>Fancy Instant Ramen Upgrade</h1>

    <image src="../images/ramen.avif"></image>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramen may have started as broke-student food, but with a few upgrades, it can pass for a trendy $12 bowl at your favorite late-night spot. This recipe takes your standard instant noodles and gives them a glow-up with soft-boiled eggs, sesame oil, and fresh greens — because you're classy now.</p>
    <p>It's still cheap, it still takes like 10 minutes, but now it has depth, complexity, and toppings that scream "I cook." Your microwave ramen just became ramen with intent.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pack of instant ramen (any flavor you like)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>A handful of baby spinach or bok choy</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <em>(Optional toppings: soy sauce, chili flakes, sesame seeds)</em>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small pot.</li>
        <li>Gently lower in the egg and boil for 6–7 minutes for a soft-boiled center. Remove and place in cold water to stop cooking.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add ramen noodles and cook according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>In the last minute of cooking, stir in spinach or bok choy until just wilted.</li>
        <li>Add seasoning packet (or half, for less salt), sesame oil, and stir.</li>
        <li>Peel the egg and slice it in half.</li>
        <li>Pour noodles and broth into a bowl, top with egg halves, green onion, and any optional toppings.</li>
