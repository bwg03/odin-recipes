    <image src="../images/toast.avif"></image>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the kind of breakfast you make when you want to feel like a fitness influencer, but you also don’t want to actually cook anything. It's just peanut butter. And a banana. On toast. But if you slice that banana just right and maybe sprinkle some cinnamon, you’re basically an aesthetic meal prep god.</p>
    <p>It’s quick, filling, protein-rich, and gives off I’m doing my best energy — and honestly, that’s enough.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter (or almond butter if you’re fancy)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>A sprinkle of cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <em>(Optional toppings: chia seeds, honey, cocoa nibs)</em>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast your bread until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on each slice.</li>
        <li>Slice banana into coins and layer them neatly (or chaotically) on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with cinnamon. Add honey or other toppings if you’re feelin’ it.</li>
        <li>Consume while gazing out the window like a character in a coming-of-age film.</li>
    </ol>
